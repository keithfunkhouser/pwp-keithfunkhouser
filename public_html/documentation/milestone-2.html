        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>My one page site will consist of the following sections</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Introduction:</strong> This section will prominently display my name and a brief one-line description that includes the title Full Stack Web Developer,
            while also emphasizing my interest in UI/UX design. The background will be a somewhat abstract design referencing New Mexico/Southwestern art styles.
            Ideally this design will have a very subtle animation on user scroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Projects:</strong> This section will be an interactive showcase of around four projects that best represent my abilities as a web developer.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Skills:</strong> This section will emphasize the languages/frameworks that I am knowledgeable in through a responsive grid of icons and their associated names.
            It will also briefly highlight soft skills like my ability to learn quickly and work effectively in a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Contact:</strong> This section will list my professional email and include a simple contact form to easily get in touch with me.
            Below that will be icons/links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
        </p>
