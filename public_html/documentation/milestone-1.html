        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img src="images/recruiter.jpg" alt="tech recruiter at his desk with coffee and laptop">
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> John Recruiter<br/>
            <strong>Age:</strong> 36<br/>
            <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br/>
            <strong>Profession:</strong> Tech recruiter for a mid-size company in Albuquerque, NM
        </p>
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Uses a Google Pixel 3 and a 2016 MacBook Pro, and is proficient in tech.</p>
        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>
            John is a personable guy who enjoys talking and getting to know other people.
            He likes his job and takes pride in his ability to quickly assess whether someone is the right fit for a job (even if he sometimes overlooks qualified candidates in his haste).
            John spends most of his time searching LinkedIn, viewing personal webpages and GitHub profiles, and calling or meeting with individuals, but at the end of the day, he just wants to kick back and relax with his friends/family.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong>
            John needs to find a junior web developer for the company he works for. He is looking for someone who is not only knowledgeable about web development, but can learn fast and be a team player.
            He gets frustrated by the sometimes limited talent pool in Albuquerque, and doesn't like spending much time on personal webpages that don't immediately impress him.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> John's goal is to quickly determine whether an individual might be a good fit for the junior web developer position. If so, he wants to be able to easily get in touch with them to schedule a call or meeting.</p>
        <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I want to determine whether I should contact this individual or not.</p>
